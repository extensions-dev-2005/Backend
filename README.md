## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Audio Capture Strategy
```
Meeting Audio ‚Üí Audio Context ‚Üí Channel Splitter
                    ‚Üì               ‚Üì
            Recording Stream    Playback Stream
                    ‚Üì               ‚Üì
            Nova.AI Backend    User's Speakers
```

This approach ensures:
- ‚úÖ User continues hearing meeting audio
- ‚úÖ Nova.AI captures audio for transcription  
- ‚úÖ Both microphone and tab audio are captured
- ‚úÖ No disruption to the meeting experience

### Backend Processing
1. **Audio Reception**: Receives audio chunks from extension
2. **Format Conversion**: Converts to Whisper-compatible format
3. **Transcription**: Uses Groq's Whisper API for speech-to-text
4. **AI Processing**: Leverages Llama models for summaries and suggestions

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Backend unavailable" Error
- Check that your backend is running on the correct port
- Verify GROQ_API_KEY environment variable is set
- Test with `curl http://localhost:8000/health`

#### Permission Denied Errors
- Grant microphone permissions to Chrome
- Allow tab capture permissions for the extension
- Reload the extension if permissions were recently granted

#### Audio Not Being Transcribed
- Check browser console for error messages
- Ensure you're on a supported website (not chrome:// pages)
- Verify backend logs for transcription errors

#### Summarization/Suggestions Not Working
- Ensure GROQ_API_KEY is valid and has credits
- Check that transcription text exists before requesting summaries
- Monitor backend logs for API errors

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:
```javascript
// In popup.js, set this flag
const DEBUG_MODE = true;
```

### Backend Health Check
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/health"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "All services operational",
  "models_loaded": {
    "groq_client": true,
    "whisper_api": true,
    "text_generation": true
  }
}
```
